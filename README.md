## 🌟 Project Overview

**Typing Race Challenge** is an interactive web app designed to help users improve typing speed and accuracy. Users type randomly generated paragraphs, track **real-time WPM, Accuracy, and Time**, and see highlights for correct, incorrect, and modified characters. Timed 60-second races keep the challenge fun, and users can toggle **light/dark mode** and review past race history.  

Built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, the project emphasizes **responsive design, real-time feedback, and a modern interface**.
